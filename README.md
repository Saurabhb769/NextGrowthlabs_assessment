question1=Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 
soluton. = considering class students which are around me from that peoples i can consider that i have created project of movie recommendation and transfer learning
project fastly and good results..but if considering too much peoples from outside i have not got chance to do that type work will consider me 10 %. In future if i got any difficult task i will do my best.


question2=Explain back propagation and tell us how you handle a dataset if 4 out of 30 parameters have null values more than 40 percentage
Solution = Backpropogation is tool which is used for increase accuracy of algorithm.
           Artificial Neural Network use backpropagation as a learning algorithm to compute a gradient descent with respect to weights.
           In backward propogation weights are updated from backward to input.
           The method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network's weights. 
           with the gradient of the final layer of weights being calculated first and the gradient of the first layer of weights being calculated last. 
           Partial computations of the gradient from one layer are reused in the computation of the gradient for the previous layer. This backwards flow of the error                information allows for efficient computation of the gradient at each layer versus the naive approach of calculating the gradient of each layer separately.
